Punny story
===========
I remember when interning at [Tagged][http://www.tagged.com/] in the summer of 2012, there was this fellow intern
from CMU who was into DJing. He was landing gigs in university and frat parties where everyone knew him already. 
During the summer however he wanted to try and play at bars and EDM clubs in San Francisco to get some ballin' street 
cred. I remember sitting with him and brainstorming stage names for his act. Of course the best stage name for a 
DJ has to be a git related pun, right? Guess what we finalized - [Dj ReBase][http://www.conciergeent.com/dj-rebase/] - cuz he's gonna drop the (git re)base.
